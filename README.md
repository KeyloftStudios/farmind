This is a simple text adventure game my friend and I have been working on in our spare time.  I have done all of the coding, while he has designed the vast majority of the storyline.  This is a fairly new WIP, so don't expect any features working 100% all of the time.  Thanks for your time!

TO PLAY:
1. Download the files as .zip
2. Extract the files from wherever you downloaded them to
3. Open index.html (You will know if you extracted correctly if the text is all centered; will only load external files if downloaded as zip.)
